									<h3>insightfactory.ai</h3>
									<h4 class="major">Product Engineer &emsp; (February 2024 - Present)</h4>
									<p>
										I started at insightfactory.ai as a cadet in 2024, where I added platform tracking analytics, providing 100,000+ data points for the data
										science and ML teams, overhauled notifications using Azure Function Apps, and improved efficiency by introducing Redis cache, and
										implemented an invoices page and internal auto-invoice generation tools, saving 10+ hours of work each month. Towards the end of 2024, I
										also aided in hiring the new team of cadets, and am continuing to work part-time during my university studies.
									<p>

									<h3>IMC Trading</h3>
									<h4 class="major">Software Engineer &emsp; (November 2024 - Janaury 2025)</h4>
									<p>
										At IMC, I designed and programmed an algorithmic trading strategy with the highest PnL in the final trading simulation, after completing
										a week of market training and a week of algorithmic trading simulations. I learnt a lot during my software engineering internship project,
										however realised I enjoyed the trading aspect more than software and so am now pursuing further experiences in trading.
									<p>

									<h3>Sole Trader</h3>
									<h4 class="major">Academic Tutor &emsp; (January 2023 - Present)</h4>
									<p>
										I provide private tutoring to students primarily for SACE Stage 2 Specialist Mathematics, Mathematical Methods, Chemistry and Physics, 
										however also offer tutoring for computer science and other levels of science and mathematics. This also involves other business activities such 
										as finding customers, managing paperwork, and planning schedules which requires a high level of organisation.
									<p>
									
									<br>

									<h3>Saint Ignatius' College, Adelaide</h3>
									<h4 class="major">Academic Tutor and Tennis Coach &emsp; (February 2023 - November 2024)</h4>
									<p>
										I was fortunate enough to be able to return to my old high school to perform some casual work, particularly aiding students after school at 
										Homework Club once a week. I also coached a year 7 tennis team which I unfortunately did not continue due to university commitments.
									<p>

									<br>

									<h3>TutorsSA</h3>
									<h4 class="major">Academic Content Creator &emsp; (January 2023 - April 2024)</h4>
									<p>
										As a contract content developer, I have produced worked solutions for various Year 5 - Year 10 mathematics worksheets and developed the full 
										range of Stage 1 Chemistry resources. I als led the expansion of the Stage 1 Specialist Mathematics resources to include full 
										worksheets and practice tests for each topic, in addition to mini-exams covering a range of topics.
