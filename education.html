									<h3>Bachelor of Mathematical and Computer Sciences</h3>
									<h4 class="major">The University of Adelaide &emsp; (February 2023 - November 2025)</h4>
									<p>
										I am in my second year of the Bachelor of Mathematical and Computer Sciences at the University of Adelaide. I am currently maintaining a perfect 
										7.0/7.0 GPA with very high marks such as a 99% in Programming (Matlab & C) and 100% in Mathematics IB. I have received two scholarships for 
										my university study, a University of Adelaide Principals' Scholarship and a City of West Torrens Mendelson Scholarship. University of Adelaide 
										Principals' Scholarships are awarded to students of high academic merit who have also made a significant contribution to their school and the 
										wider community, and City of West Torrens Mendelson Scholarships are awarded to residents of the City of West Torrens on the basis of academic 
										merit, leadership potential, and capability.
									<p>
									<p>
										I am an active member of the Univeristy of Adelaide community, including the Computer Science, Competitive Programming, and Capture the Flag 
										Clubs. Additionally, I am the Secretary and a founding member of the University of Adelaide Mahjong Club, aiming to expose the game of mahjong 
										to more people and increase its accessibility. I am also a long time member of the Adelaide University Hockey Club, having played for the club 
										since 2015, and helped out with umpiring and staffing the bar.
									<p>

									<h3>South Australian Certificate of Education</h3>
									<h4 class="major">Saint Ignatius' College, Adelaide &emsp; (January 2010 - November 2022)</h4>
									<p>
										I completed my primary and secondary education at Saint Ignatius' College, where I gained a full academic scholarship for years 10, 11 and 
										12. At the end of 2022, I graduated with the highest ATAR of 99.80, and SACE merits in chemistry (20.0/20.0), physics (19.9/20.0) and specialist 
										mathematics (19.9/20.0). I also received the Way College Prize and Medal for achieving the highest marks in Stage 2 Chemistry across SA/NT. 
										Throughout my time at the college I received numerous other awards for both academic achievement and personal conduct. Among these are 10 speech 
										day awards in my senior year, including the Australian Defence Force Future Innovators Award, subject prizes for my five main subjects, senior 
										school special prizes, and prizes for contribution, involvement and service to co-curricular and the college community. In previous years I 
										also received a total of 19 other speech day awards for aggregate achievement and various subject prizes. Across my time at the college I 
										received 12 co-curricular awards, comprised of 7 Most Valuable Player awards and 5 Loyola awards, given for a high level of sportsmanship and 
										commitment.								
									<p>
									<p>
										I actively participated in many aspects of the college community, including various co-curricular activities such as tennis, table tennis, 
										hockey, and concert band. I also participated in various science and mathematics competitions such as the ICAS, AMC, and SMC for which I 
										received numerous credits, distinctions, high distinctions, and an equal 6th place in Hamann Schools Mathematics Competition for Society of 
										Petroleum Engineers (2017 Primary Section). I also took part in various volunteering programs such as helping at Treasure Boxes, an 
										organisations that focusses of providing for children and families in need, and Mary Mags Dinners, who prepare three-course meals and help 
										provide a sense of community for those who might not otherwise have a place to be. I also assisted my teacher give a presentation at the 
										EdTechSA conference in 2019 to prepare secondary school staff for teaching mobile app development in Lua. Finally, during my senior year I 
										participated in the spiritual retreat program, and returned twice as a leader.
									<p>

									<h3>Algorithms & Number Theory</h3>
									<h4 class="major">National Mathematics Summer School &emsp; (January 2022)</h4>
									<p>
										I was fortunate enough to be 1 of 5 students from South Australia selected to participate in NMSS 2022. Even more fortunately, the topics to be 
										studied that year happened to be number theory (with a focus on modular arithmetic) and algorithms, which were perfectly suited to my passion 
										for programming.
									<p>
									<p>
										Unfortunately due to COVID, NMSS took place online that year rather than at Australian National University, but I still met a lot of fun and 
										interesting people, learnt a lot, and had a great time.
